# LoLTeams
League of Legends web app that allows players to create, manage and coordinate teams.

## TODO:
1. ~~Basic front-end that connects to API~~
2. User login/create account
3. Refactor routes since there is some repeated code
4. Handle leader role selection on team creation
5. Store and get user id on client-side
6. Handle fetch error and success (includes server response formats)
7. Change DB to catch errors and not crash

## Future
1. Translate routes to graphQL
